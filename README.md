When I was a kid, my family would limit the amount of time I could spend on the computer. My classmates always had higher levels in games than I did, so I often fantasized about having a hacker write scripts for me to automate leveling up. Now that I've grown up, AI can bring my imagined processes to life by generating code effortlessly, fulfilling my childhood dream.

I'm not actually very familiar with Python, so this side project was quite a challenge for me. I'm really happy that I managed to complete this MVP in just two days!
